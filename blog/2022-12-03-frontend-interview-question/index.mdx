:::info What are the different types of errors in JavaScript?
There are three types of errors:

- Load time errors: Errors that come up when loading a web page, like improper syntax errors, are known as Load time errors and generate the errors dynamically.
- Runtime errors: Errors that come due to misuse of the command inside the HTML language.
- Logical errors: These are the errors that occur due to the bad logic performed on a function with a different operation.

:::info What are the various functional components in JavaScript?
The different functional components in JavaScript are

- First-class functions: Functions in JavaScript are utilized as first-class objects. This usually means that these functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, assigned to variables, or can also be stored in data structures.
- Nested functions: The functions, which are defined inside other functions, are called Nested functions. They are called ‘every time the main function is invoked.

### What is code-splitting?
Bundling is great, but as your app grows, your bundle will grow too. Especially if you are including large third-party libraries. You need to keep an eye on the code you are including in your bundle so that you don’t accidentally make it so large that your app takes a long time to load.

To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.

Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.

### What is dynamic import?

:::tip
### What is dynamic import?
React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspense component, which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while we’re waiting for the lazy component to load.


#### Avoid fallback
Any component may suspend as a result of rendering, even components that were already shown to the user. In order for screen content to always be consistent, if an already shown component suspends, React has to hide its tree up to the closest `<Suspense>` boundary. However, from the user’s perspective, this can be disorienting.

However, sometimes this user experience is not desirable. In particular, it is sometimes better to show the “old” UI while the new UI is being prepared. ==> Using startTransition to fixed it

### [VI - What is the difference between Process and Thread?](https://cloudgeeks.net/thread-va-process)

- A process in OS can remain in any of the following states:

```
NEW: A new process is being created.
READY: A process is ready and waiting to be allocated to a processor.
RUNNING: The program is being executed.
WAITING: Waiting for some event to happen or occur.
TERMINATED: Execution finished.
